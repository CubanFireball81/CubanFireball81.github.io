# Alejandro Santiago Web Portfolio

My personal portfolio website.

## Description

This is an ongoing project and will be updated with new technologies, designs, and styles as I learn them. This portfolio website is meant to showcase my skills and experiences on my path to become a Full Stack Developer.

Each section is intuitively named and overall I liked using the WinBox library to provide a fun way to present my sections. I am always open to receiving feedback and constructive criticism so please feel free to contact me. 

## Getting Started

To run the project just open the html file in an internet browser.

### Dependencies

There are no special dependencies or requirements to run this project as all the code needed is provided.

### Roadmap of Future Improvements

I will be updating my portfolio frequently with new things I learn. My projects section is being populated regularly with projects that I have already built and are moving over, and with new projects from my MIT Full Stack certificate program. Please check back frequently as I anticipate making this project better.
